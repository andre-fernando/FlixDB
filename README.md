This is an Android app that creates an interface for "[The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/). The app allows you to view top rated/popular movies and save them to your favourites. It also allows you to view the trailers of the movie and read its reviews.

## Key Features:
* Uses Room Architectural components and Live Data.
* Uses the Model View ViewModel(MVVM) pattern.
* Connects to remote database and converts the received JSON string.
* Uses a preference fragment for settings.
* Uses AsyncTasks to run background processes.
* Uses [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) to handle images.
* Has a Content Provider and an android test to test it.
* All variable names are simple and self explanatory.


Note: You will need to add an API key [here](https://github.com/andre-fernando/FlixDB/blob/master/app/src/main/java/comandre_fernando/httpsgithub/flixdb/components/constants/BaseUrl.java) to get the app working.
